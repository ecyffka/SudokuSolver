# SudokuSolver

# What is the problem?
### We want to see if logical programming is suitable for combinatorial problems-- specifically a Sudoku solver. We were advised that Prolog executes search in a brute force fashion, so we'll be paying attention to inefficiencies and potential optimizations.

# What is the something extra?
### A "hint" feature that will partially solve a given Sudoku puzzle, and a Sudoku generator that will generate solvable puzzles of varying difficulties.

# What did we learn from doing this?
### TBD
